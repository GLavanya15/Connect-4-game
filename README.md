# Connect Four Game 🎮

This project is a digital implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game, built using **Python** and **Pygame**. It provides an interactive and visually appealing interface for two players to compete in this timeless strategy game.

## Features 🚀
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The game uses Pygame to render a colorful and engaging game board.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Players take turns dropping their pieces (Red for Player 1, Yellow for Player 2).
- **Winning Detection:** The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments of four pieces to declare the winner.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** Mouse events are used for piece placement, enhancing user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Real-time updates to the board and interactive feedback as players hover over columns.

## How to Play 🎲
1. **Objective:** Be the first player to align four of your pieces in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2. Players take turns clicking on the column where they want to drop their piece.
3. The game announces the winner and highlights the winning move.

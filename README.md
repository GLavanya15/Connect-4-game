Connect Four Game 🎮
This project is a digital implementation of the classic Connect Four game, built using Python and Pygame. It provides an interactive and visually appealing interface for two players to compete in this timeless strategy game.

Features 🚀
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game uses Pygame to render a colorful and engaging game board.
Two-Player Mode: Players take turns dropping their pieces (Red for Player 1, Yellow for Player 2).
Winning Detection: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments of four pieces to declare the winner.
Dynamic Interaction: Mouse events are used for piece placement, enhancing user experience.
Responsive Design: Real-time updates to the board and interactive feedback as players hover over columns.
How to Play 🎲
Objective: Be the first player to align four of your pieces in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Players take turns clicking on the column where they want to drop their piece.
The game announces the winner and highlights the winning move.
